= Developer Onboarding with Dev Spaces

* Imagine you are a new developer joining a project called GuestBook. Your onboarding is going to be quick and seamless, thanks to OpenShift Dev Spaces. Here’s how your journey begins:
* Your manager has provided you with a link to access **OpenShift Dev Spaces** through your browser. 
* The moment you click the link, the **Dev Spaces Gateway** authenticates your credentials and directs your request to the Dev Spaces Server. 
* This server then processes your request and sends back the necessary information to display the **DevSpaces Dashboard** in your browser.
* Once on the dashboard, you’ll see the GuestBook project listed. Clicking on it will initiate the next step: the Dev Spaces Server reads the devfile for the GuestBook project. 
* This devfile contains all the essential information about runtimes, dependencies, and development tools that are required to start working on the project.
* From there, the **Dev Spaces Server** creates a dedicated Project in OpenShift just for you, and spins up a workspace configured exactly as specified in the devfile.
* This entire process ensures that you have the perfect development environment tailored for your project, without needing to set anything up manually.

* A pop-up will appear asking, “Do you trust the authors of the files in this folder?” This is a standard security measure to ensure that the files you are about to use are safe and come from a reliable source.
* Click the **Yes, I trust the authors** button.

* Now that we’ve set up the workspace, let’s quickly switch back to the OpenShift console to see what happened behind the scenes during this process.
* In the top left corner of your OpenShift console, click the **Project dropdown list**. This list shows all the available projects currently deployed on your OpenShift cluster.
* You will notice a new project called **user1-devspaces** has been automatically created for you. This project was provisioned by OpenShift Dev Spaces to serve as your personal development space, based on the devfile configuration.
