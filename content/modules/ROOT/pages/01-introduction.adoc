= Supercharge Developer Experience with OpenShift Dev Spaces

== Introduction

* *OpenShift Dev Spaces* is a cloud-based integrated development environment (IDE) hosted on the Red Hat OpenShift platform. 
* It is designed to streamline and enhance the developer experience in a cloud-native landscape.
* This powerful tool allows developers to rapidly spin up containerized development environments, offering immediate access to essential resources and tools, all accessible directly from the cloud.
* With *OpenShift Dev Spaces*, developers can create, build, and test applications entirely within the Red Hat OpenShift ecosystem, without needing to configure local development environments.
*  All that’s required is a web browser, making the process simple and accessible.
* In this module, we will walk you through the installation process, demonstrate how to navigate the OpenShift Dev Spaces interface, and explore its key components to help you maximize your development efficiency. 

== Lab 1: Installing OpenShift Dev Spaces

NOTE: Before proceeding with the lab instructions, you can watch this short video that provides a walkthrough of the installation steps for *OpenShift Dev Spaces*.

=== Accessing the OpenShift Console

* Begin by logging into your **OpenShift console** as a cluster admin.
* Your moderator will provide the Console URL, and the credentials.

---

=== Installing the OpenShift Dev Spaces Operator

* Once logged in, navigate to the **Operator Hub**, the central location where you can find and deploy various operators to your OpenShift cluster.
* In the search bar within the **Operator Hub**, type `Dev Spaces`. This will filter the list of available operators.
* Look for the *Red Hat OpenShift Dev Spaces* operator in the search results. This is the official Red Hat operator for Dev Spaces.

---

* Click on the operator to view more detailed information about its capabilities, features, and configuration options.
* Proceed by clicking on the **Install** button.

---

* Follow the on-screen instructions on the *Install Operator* screen to configure the installation settings.
* Please do not change the *Installed Namespaces* option; keep it set to *openshift-operators*.
* Keep the default settings and click the *Install* button to initiate the installation process.

---

* After a few moments, the *Dev Spaces Operator* will be ready for use.
* Click on the *View installed Operators in Namespace openshift-operators* link to switch to the *Installed Operators* view.

* Note that two new Operators have been installed: **Red Hat OpenShift Dev Spaces Operator** and **DevWorkspace Operator**.
* Click on the `Red Hat OpenShift Dev Spaces Instance Specification` link found in the *Provided APIs* column of the Red Hat *OpenShift Dev Spaces* Operator.

=== Creating a CheCluster

* In the Red Hat OpenShift Dev Spaces page, click the **Create CheCluster** button.

NOTE: In *OpenShift Dev Spaces*, the term *Che cluster* refers to an installation of *Eclipse Che*, which is the upstream open-source project of Red Hat *OpenShift Dev Spaces*.

---

* Switch to the *Yaml View*.
* Under the spec section, locate the metrics attribute. Ensure you maintain the same indentation as the metrics attribute, then add the following code beneath it:

```yaml
pluginRegistry:
      openVSXURL: 'https://open-vsx.org'
```
* After adding the code, click the *Create* button to create the *CheCluster*.

NOTE: This code configures the *Dev Spaces workspace* to pull plugins from the link:https://open-vsx.org/[*Open VSX Registry*,window=_blank], which allows users to extend their development environment with a wide range of VSCode-compatible plugins.

---

* Switch to the *Developer Perspective* within the OpenShift console. 
* Search and click on the *openshift-operators* project.
* Once there, switch to the *Topology view* to visually monitor the status of the pods associated with *OpenShift Dev Spaces*.
* Keep an eye on the pods until all are fully operational and show a status of *Running* (dark blue circle around pod).

NOTE: It may take up to 5 minutes for all the pods to be up and running.

=== OpenShift Dev Spaces Core Components 

* Now that the initial setup is complete, let's familiarize ourselves with the core five components of **OpenShift Dev Spaces**.

==== 1. User Dashboard

* The *User Dashboard* is the central landing page for OpenShift Dev Spaces, where users can access and manage their workspaces. 
* It is designed to provide a simple yet powerful interface for interacting with various workspace functionalities.

==== 2. Plugin Registry 

* The *Plugin Registry* stores a variety of plugins that can extend the development environment. 
* These plugins may provide additional language support, developer tools, or integrations with external services.

==== 3. Dev Spaces Server

 * The *Dev Spaces Server* is the central orchestrator of the platform. 
 * It manages the creation, management, and deletion of workspaces, handling key tasks like authentication, authorization, user profiles, and integration with other services.

==== 4. The Gateway

* The *Gateway*, based on *Traefik*, acts as the secure entry point for routing traffic efficiently between the user’s workspace and external networks.
* It directs requests to various components of *OpenShift Dev Spaces*, such as the *User Dashboard*, *Dev Spaces Server*, *Plugin Registry*, and individual user workspaces.
* The *Gateway* is critical for integrating external services and tools, providing controlled access while maintaining network security and isolation essential for collaborative development activities.

* Now that we’ve covered the core components of *OpenShift Dev Spaces*, it’s time to dive deeper into the concept of  *workspaces*.

== What is a Workspace?

* A *workspace* is a containerized instance of a development environment tailored for a single user.
* It allows you to write, build, run, or debug code, all within the *inner loop* of development lifecycle. 
* *Workspaces* are designed to maximize developer productivity by providing all the necessary tools in one place. 
* Here’s what a typical workspace might include:

	• *Language Runtime/Development Kits*: Whether you’re coding in Node.js, Java (using JDKs), or Python, the right runtime environments and development kits are ready for you.
	• *Build Tools*: Tools like Maven or Gradle are available to handle project builds efficiently, ensuring that you can compile and prepare your applications with ease.
	• *Command Line Interfaces (CLIs)*: Direct access to OpenShift CLIs and other essential tools right from your workspace, enabling seamless interaction with your applications and services.
	• *Binaries*: Essential binaries to run various processes such as application servers or message brokers are part of your workspace, ensuring you have everything you need to get your applications up and running.
