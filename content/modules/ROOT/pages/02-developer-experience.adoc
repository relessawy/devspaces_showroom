= Developer Experience with Dev Spaces

* Imagine you are a new developer joining a project called *GuestBook*. 
* Thanks to *OpenShift Dev Spaces*, your journey to start coding is streamlined, and fully automated. 
* Here’s how your journey looks like:
. Your manager provides you with a link to access *OpenShift Dev Spaces* directly from your browser.
. The moment you click the link, the **Dev Spaces Gateway** authenticates your credentials and directs your request to the *Dev Spaces Server*. 
. The *Dev Spaces Server* processes the request and sends the necessary information back to your browser, displaying the *Dev Spaces Dashboard*.
. On the *Dev Spaces Dashboard*, you’ll provide the link to your *GuestBook* project. 
. The *Dev Spaces Server* reads the *devfile* for the project.
. The *devfile* contains all the essential information you need to start developing—runtimes, dependencies, and development tools. Everything is pre-configured for you.
. Once the *Dev Spaces Server* reads the *devfile*, it creates a dedicated Project in OpenShift just for you, and spins up a *workspace* configured exactly as specified in the *devfile*.
. This entire process ensures that you have a fully tailored development environment without needing to set up anything manually. You’re ready to code from the moment you access the project.

image::developer_onboarding.png[]

* In the next section, we will deep dive into *Devfiles*. 
* We’ll explore how they enable the *Development Environment as Code* paradigm, making it easier to automate, version control, and manage your development environments.

---

== Development Environment as Code with Devfiles

* The concept of *Development Environment as Code* represents a significant shift in the way we set up and manage development environments. 
* By treating these configurations as code, developers can leverage automation, apply version control, and ensure consistency across various setups. 
* This approach simplifies the complex process of configuring individual environments and aligns it with modern DevOps practices.
* At the heart of this paradigm is the *Devfile*, a powerful YAML configuration file used by **OpenShift Dev Spaces**. 
* *Devfiles* act as comprehensive blueprints for setting up development environments, defining everything from runtime environments to the necessary tools and commands needed for a project.

---

=== Features and Benefits of Devfiles

	* *Automation-Ready*: *Devfiles* are designed to automate the setup of development environments, reducing manual configuration errors and speeding up the onboarding process for new developers.
	* *Version Controlled*: Like any other piece of code, *Devfiles* can be versioned using standard source control tools. This allows you to track changes, roll back to previous configurations, and ensure that every team member is working with the same environment settings.
	* *Consistent & Portable*: *Devfiles* provide a consistent development environment across different machines or platforms. This portability ensures that developers can work seamlessly, irrespective of whether they are coding locally or in a cloud environment.

---

=== Anatomy of a Devfile

==== Projects (Optional)

* The *Projects* section is used to specify source code repositories that are essential for the development environment. 
* It includes details like the repository URL and the specific branch, tag, or commit to be used, ensuring that the *workspace* is pre-populated with the correct code version upon initialization.

==== Components: 

* *Components* are the building blocks of the development environment. The can be of type:
. *Container*: Defines the container image containing the runtime environment, development tools, and dependencies.
. *Kubernetes/OpenShift Resources*: Incorporates Kubernetes or OpenShift-specific resources such as Routes and BuildConfigs into the workspace.
. *Volume*: Provides persistent storage necessary for certain data within the development environment.
. *Plugin*: Extends the capabilities of the development environment by adding IDE features or integrating additional tools and services.

==== Commands (Optional): 

* The **Commands** section outlines specific actions that can be executed within the development environment, such as build, run, and test commands. 
* These *commands* are defined to automate tasks and facilitate a consistent development workflow across different environments. 
* Each *command* can specify a working directory, an associated container, and the actual command line to execute.

==== Events (Optional): 

* The *Events* section in a *devfile* handles the lifecycle events of the workspace, such as pre-start, post-start, pre-stop, and post-stop events.
* These events trigger specific commands at different stages of the workspace lifecycle, enabling the setup or teardown of services and tools necessary for the development process.
* This mechanism ensures that certain tasks are automatically handled at the appropriate times, enhancing both the efficiency and reliability of the development environment.

* Now it’s time to try this out hands-on. In this module, you’ll experience firsthand how *OpenShift Dev Spaces* streamlines the process of joining a new project.

---

== Lab 2.1 Joining a new project

=== Lab 2.1.1: Login to OpenShift Dev Spaces

* Open the *Red Hat Applications* menu by using the *three-by-three matrix* icon in the upper right corner of the main screen.
* Click the *OpenShift Dev Spaces* link to open the *Dev Spaces Dashboard*.


image::three_by_three_matrix.png[]

---

* You will be asked to provide your *OpenShift* credentials to login.
* On the *Authorize Access* screen, click the *Allow Select Permissions* button to grant the necessary permissions.

image::authorize_access.png[]

---

* Once authenticated, you will be greeted by the **OpenShift Dev Spaces dashboard**, your central hub for managing workspaces and projects.

image::dev_spaces_dashboard.png[]

---

=== Lab 2.1.2: Create your first workspace

* Let’s create a workspace for the *GuestBook* project.
* Paste the following link to the GitHub repository into the field **Git Repo URL** within the dashboard to import the project.

[source, role="execute"]
----
https://github.com/relessawy/devspaces_workshop/
----

* Click the **Create & Open** button

image::import_from_git.png[]

NOTE: You can choose to start your workspace using either *Microsoft Visual Studio Code* or *JetBrains IntelliJ IDEA*, depending on your preferred development tool. This workshop guide is based on *Microsoft Visual Studio Code*.

---

* It will take the *Dev Spaces server* a few minutes to process the *devfile* and spin up your *workspace*.

image::starting_workspace.png[]

---

* A pop-up will appear, asking, “Do you trust the authors of the files in this folder?” This is a standard security measure to ensure that the files you are about to use are safe and come from a reliable source.
* Click the **Yes, I trust the authors** button.

image::trust_authors.png[]

---

=== Lab 2.1.3: Explore workspace pods

* Now that your *workspace* is set up, let’s switch back to the *OpenShift* console to see what happened behind the scenes during this process.
* In the top left corner of the OpenShift console, click the *Project dropdown list* to view all projects.
* You will notice a new project called *admin-devspaces* has been automatically created for you. 
* This project was automatically created by *OpenShift Dev Spaces* to host your personal development environment based on the *devfile* configuration.
* Select **admin-devspaces** to switch to this project.

image::project_list.png[]

---

* Let’s take a closer look at the pod hosting your *workspace* within the *admin-devspaces* project. 

image::workspace_pod.png[]

* To gain deeper insights into the pod’s details, switch to the *Administrator* perspective in your OpenShift console.
* In the *Administrator* view, go to *Workloads* and select Pods. 
* You’ll see that the pod associated with your *workspace* has two running containers.

image::pods_view.png[]

* Click on the pod associated with your workspace to drill a bit deeper. The two running containers are:
• *nodejs*: This container provides the Node.js runtime, which is essential for running your *GuestBook* application.
• **che-gateway**: This container is responsible for managing the gateway operations that route traffic and commands within your workspace.

image::workspace_containers.png[]

---

=== Lab 2.1.4: Examine the Guestbook devfile

* Let’s return to your *VSCode* tab in the browser to take a closer look at the *devfile* used for our *GuestBook* project. 
* This *devfile* serves as the blueprint for setting up the development environment.

image::guestbook_devfile.png[]

==== 1. Components
* We start by listing our components, In this case, the *devfile* defines a Node.js container that provides the runtime for the *GuestBook* application.


==== 2. Universal Developer Image (UDI)
* We are are using the *Universal Developer Image (UDI)* to create this container.
* The *UDI* is a versatile image that includes all the essential runtimes and tools developers need to code efficiently, making it an ideal choice for development environments.

==== 3. Volume

* Next, we define a volume named NPM to store our dependencies.
* This volume ensures that our dependencies are preserved across container restarts and development sessions.

==== 4. Commands

* Lastly, we define the commands that can be executed within the *workspace*. 
* In the case of the *GuestBook* project, we have commands to build and run the application, allowing us to easily execute project-related tasks from within the workspace.

---

=== Lab 2.1.5: Test the run command

* Let’s go ahead and execute the *Run the application* defined in the *devfile*.
* You’ll notice that the *Task Manager* extension is already pre-installed in your workspace.

image:task_manager_ext.png[]

* Any extensions defined in the `extensions.json` file located under the `.vscode` folder will automatically be pre-installed in your *workspace*. 
* This ensures a standardized development environment for all developers working on the *GuestBook* project.

image:extensions_file.png[]

* The *Task Manager* extension simplifies running the commands defined in our *devfile*.
* To run the application, select and run the command *Run the application command* under the *devfile* section in *Task Manager*.

image::run_command.png[]

* This command will execute an `npm install` to fetch the necessary dependencies, followed by running the application using `Node.js`.
* Uh oh, we’ve run into a problem! The application is unable to run because the *GuestBook* project requires *MongoDB* to operate properly.

image::missing_mongodb.png[]

---

== Lab 2.2 Adding components to the devfile

* To resolve this, we need to inject an additional *MongoDB* component into our *devfile*, by using the following yaml snippet:

```yaml
- name: mongo
    container:
      image: registry.redhat.io/rhscl/mongodb-36-rhel7:1-50
      env:
        - name: MONGODB_USER
          value: user
        - name: MONGODB_PASSWORD
          value: password
        - name: MONGODB_DATABASE
          value: guestbook
        - name: MONGODB_ADMIN_PASSWORD
          value: password
      endpoints:
        - name: mongodb
          exposure: internal
          targetPort: 27017
      memoryLimit: 512Mi
      mountSources: false
      volumeMounts:
        - name: mongo-storage
          path: /var/lib/mongodb/data
  - name: mongo-storage
    volume:
      size: 1G
```

---

=== Lab 2.2.1: Updating your dashboard workspaces

* Instead of manually creating a new workspace from a repository every time, wouldn’t it be great if we had all our *workspaces* readily available in the *OpenShift Dev Spaces Dashboard*?
* *OpenShift Dev Spaces* can parse a *JSON* file that contains key details about each workspace, such as its name, description, and the URL of the *devfile* it uses to configure the environment.
* This configuration is handled through a *ConfigMap* named `getting-started-samples`.
* Your workspace already includes a JSON file called `getting-started-samples.json`, which contains the configuration for the workspaces needed in our labs. Feel free to explore this file to see how the workspaces are defined.

image::update_dashboard.png[]

* Let’s configure the *OpenShift Dev Spaces Dashboard* to use the predefined workspaces.
* Open a new terminal in your workspace

image::open_new_terminal.png[]

* Execute the following command to create a new *ConfigMap* from the *JSON* file:

[source, role="execute"]
----
 oc create configmap getting-started-samples --from-file=getting-started-samples.json -n openshift-operators
----

* Add the necessary labels to the ConfigMap by running the following command:

[source, role="execute"]
----
 oc label configmap getting-started-samples app.kubernetes.io/part-of=che.eclipse.org app.kubernetes.io/component=getting-started-samples -n openshift-operators
----

* Refresh your *OpenShift Dev Spaces Dashboard*.
* You will now see new projects add to your dashboard including one called *GuestBook Lab 2.2*.

image::updated_dashboard.png[]

---

=== Lab 2.2.2: Create GuestBook Lab 2.2 workspace

* Go ahead and select the *GuestBook Lab 2.2* project.
* Note that *OpenShift Dev Spaces* is configured so that a developer can only run one workspace at a time to optimize resources. In module 3, we will explore how to change this policy.
* For this lab, choose the option to close running workspace (guestbook) and restart.

image::close_and_open_new_workspace.png[]

---

* The *OpenShift Dev Spaces* server will process the updated *devfile*.
* As the workspace restarts, switch back to the *OpenShift* console to inspect the pods. 
* You’ll now see that the pod hosting your workspace is spinning up three containers instead of two.
* Upon inspecting the pod, you’ll find that a *mongo* container is now part of your deployment.

image::workspace_pod_with_3_containers.png[]

---

=== Lab 2.2.3: Test the updated devfile

* Feel free to explore the updated *devfile* in this *workspace*.
* Let's do another build and run for our application.
* Once again, select and run the command *Run the application command* under the *devfile* section in *Task Manager*.
* As we might expect, the application connects successfully to the mongo database, and we get a popup asking if we want to open our *GuestBook* application in a new tab.
* Click the *Open in New Tab* button.
* Confirm the action to allow VSCode to open the external site by clicking *Open*.

image::open_web_app.png[]

* You should now see the *GuestBook* application running in a separate tab.

NOTE: If you see an a message *Application is not available*, make sure the route URL starts with HTTP and not HTTPS.

image:my_guest_book.png[]

---

== Lab 2.3 Testing and Debugging with OpenShift Dev Spaces

* Now that we have our *GuestBook* application up and running in *OpenShift Dev Spaces*, it’s time to start testing and debugging the application, just as you would in a local development environment. 
* In this lab, we will demonstrate how to leverage the inner loop capabilities of *OpenShift Dev Spaces* to debug and inspect your application within the cloud-native workspace.

NOTE: Before proceeding with the lab instructions, you can watch this short video that provides a walkthrough of the steps to test and debug an application in *OpenShift Dev Spaces*.

video::02_3_testing_and_debugging.mp4[]

---

=== Lab 2.3.1 Inspect messages in MongoDB

* While your workspace can come predefined with extensions, you still have the flexibility to add your favorite extensions, ensuring your development environment suits your workflow.
* Begin by installing the *MongoDB for VS Code* extension to your workspace.

image:install_mongodb_for_vscode_ext.png[]

* Click on the Connect button to create a connection with *Connection String*. 
* Establish a connection to the GuestBook database using the following connection string:

[source, role="execute"]
----
mongodb://user:password@localhost:27017/guestbook
----

image:establish_connection_to_mongodb.png[]

---

* Now that you’re connected to the *GuestBook* database, you can inspect all the messages stored within it.
* Go ahead and provide some new messages in the GuestBook application, for example: "Hello World! from Eddie"

image:eddie_says_hello_world.png[]

* After submitting your messages in the application, you’ll be able to trace those messages directly in the *GuestBook* database. This allows you to verify that the application is correctly storing and retrieving data as expected.

image:message_trace.png[]

---

=== Lab 2.3.2 Testing and Debugging

* As part of the inner loop capabilities, you can test and debug your application directly within your *workspace* in *OpenShift Dev Spaces*.
* First, terminate the *Run Application* task to allow us to start the application in *debug mode*.

image:terminate_task.png[]

* Open the main application file *app.js* and add a *breakpoint* at *line 39*. 
* Copy the variable saveMessages in your clipboard. 

image:add_break_point.png[]

* In the left-hand menu, click on the *Run and Debug* icon.
* From the dropdown at the top, select *Node.js* as the process to attach to.
* Choose the *Run Script: Debug* option to initiate the debug process.

image:start_run_debug_process.png[]

*	Finally, click *Start Debugging* to begin debugging your application in *OpenShift Dev Spaces*.

image:start_debugging.png[]

* You will be prompted to open the debugging port *9229*. Click *Yes* to accept and proceed.

image:open_debugging_port.png[]

* A pop-up will ask if you want to open a new tab for your Node.js application. Click *Open in New Tab*.

image:open_app_in_debug_mode.png[]

* Another pop-up will ask if you want to allow external website access. Click *Open* to confirm.

image:confirm_open_app.png[]

* To continue the application’s execution, click the Resume button in the debugger.

image:resume_app.png[]

* You can now add a watch to the variable *savedMessages* to monitor its value during execution.

image:add_Watch_savedMessages.png[]

* Let’s add a new record to the *GuestBook*. For example, submit a new message through the GuestBook interface: "Hello World from Ella!".

image:hello_world_from_Ella.png[]

*	In the debugger’s upper menu, select Step Over to advance the execution line by line.

image:step_over.png[]

* You will see all the messages that have been submitted, displayed through the savedMessages variable.

image:watch_messages.png[]

* Once you’re done, you can stop the debugger and terminate the debugging session.

image:stop_debugger.png[]


---

== Lab 2.4 Customizing the Universal Developer Image (UDI)

* One of the things you might want to do is monitor the performance of your *MongoDB* instance using a command like *mongostat*.

* Let’s try running this command in a new terminal. 

[source, role="execute"]
----
mongostat -u admin -p password --authenticationDatabase admin
----

* Unfortunately, you will see that this command is not available in your workspace because it is not part of the *Universal Developer Image (UDI)*.

image:mongostat_command_not_found.png[]

---

* Fear not, it’s easy to customize the *UDI* to create your own custom container with the additional tools you need. 
* In the next steps, we will build a custom image based on the *Universal Developer Image* after adding the *MongoDB database tools* using the following *Dockerfile*:

```bash
FROM registry.redhat.io/devspaces/udi-rhel8:3.5

RUN curl -fsSL -o mongodb-database-tools-x86_64.rpm https://fastdl.mongodb.org/tools/db/mongodb-database-tools-rhel80-x86_64-100.7.0.rpm && \
    dnf install -y ./mongodb-database-tools-x86_64.rpm; \
    rm -f ./mongodb-database-tools-x86_64.rpm
```


* In your terminal, make sure you are in the project *admin-devspaces* 

[source, role="execute"]
----
oc project admin-devspaces
----

* Next, create a new *image stream* in *OpenShift* by applying the configuration file:

[source, role="execute"]
----
oc apply -f ./build/imagestream.yaml
----

* Now, create the *BuildConfig* that will be used to build the new custom image:

[source, role="execute"]
----
oc apply -f build/buildconfig.yaml 
----

* Finally, use the following command to start building the custom image:

[source, role="execute"]
----
oc start-build guestbook-dev-environment
----

* You can check the build logs using this command:

[source, role="execute"]
----
oc logs -f build/guestbook-dev-environment-1
----

* You should see an output similar to the following:

image:build_custom_udi.png[]

---

* You can now view the new image we created by switching to the *ImageStreams view* in your *OpenShift Console*.

image:new_image_stream.png[]

---

* To test the new custom developer image, we need to point to it in our *devfile*.
* In your *OpenShift Dev Spaces Dashboard* switch to the *workspace* *GuestBook Lab2.4*
* Just like before, choose the option to close running workspace (guestbook-lab2-2) and restart
* Feel free to examine the updated *devfile* in your workspace.  
* Note that the image for the Node.js container is now pointing to the custom image we created earlier.

image:lab_2_4_devfile.png[]

---

* Let’s test the *mongostat* command again in our terminal by running the following:

[source, role="execute"]
----
mongostat -u admin -p password --authenticationDatabase admin
----

* This time, the command runs successfully, and you can see the performance statistics from your *MongoDB* instance.

image:mongostat_results.png[]

* To stop monitoring and exit the command, press CTRL+C.

---

== Lab 2.5 Switch to a new project

* As a developer, it’s common to switch between different projects to perform tasks like implementing new features in a project or fixing defects in another project.
* On a local development environment, this often requires supporting different technology stacks on the developer’s laptop, which can lead to conflicts due to dependency mismatches.
* With *OpenShift Dev Spaces*, switching between projects is much easier. You simply spin up a new *workspace* for your new project, avoiding local setup conflicts.

image:project_switch.png[]

---
NOTE: Before proceeding with the lab instructions, you can watch this short video that provides a walkthrough of the steps to run a Camel route in OpenShift Dev Spaces.

video::02_3_testing_and_debugging.mp4[]

* In your *OpenShift Dev Spaces Dashboard* select the workspace *Camel Project*.
* Once your new workspace is running, you’ll notice that a set of new extensions is being installed. 
These extensions, defined in ’.vscode/extensions.json’, are configured to help you work with *Apache Camel*.
* The most notable extension is *Kaoto*, a visual editor for Camel routes.

```json
{  
  "recommendations": [
    "redhat.vscode-kaoto",
    "redhat.vscode-yaml",
    "redhat.vscode-apache-camel",
    "redhat.vscode-debug-adapter-apache-camel",
    "redhat.vscode-camelk",
    "cnshenj.vscode-task-manager"
  ]  
}
```
---

* Allow the extensions to fully install in your new workspace.
* Press SHIFT+CTRL+P or SHIFT+CMD+P on Mac to open the command palette.
* Select the command *Camel: Create a Camel Route using YAML DSL*

image:create_camel_route_using_yaml_dsl.png[]

---

* Choose a name for your route, for example: *sample-route*.

image:create_sample_route.png[]

* In the terminal, select Option 3 and press Enter.
* Watch as the Camel CLI (JBang), does the heavy lifting on our behalf and creates the sample Camel route.

image:choose_option_3.png[]

---

* The Camel route will now be displayed in the *Kaoto editor*, allowing you to visually edit, test, and run your Camel route.
* In Task Manger, run the task *Run Camel application with JBang*

image:run_camel_route.png[]

---

* You will see the results of running the sample route in the terminal.
* Press CTRL+C to stop running the Camel application.

image:camel_route_run.png[]
